        <h2><center><font face="cooper black">Welcome to My Wikipedia!</font></center></h2>

<p>My Wikipidea is a personal encyclopedia where I collect, organize, and share articles on topics that fascinate me—from art and science to history, technology, and hobbies. Every page is written in a simple, easy-to-understand way as I develop my web skills using only HTML. This project is both a learning journey and a creative space where I document new facts, tutorials, and ideas that inspire me.</p>

<h4>On My Wikipidea, you’ll find:</h4>
<ul>

<li>Step-by-step tutorials to help you learn new skills and understand complex subjects quickly.</li>


<li>“Did You Know?” facts to spark curiosity and encourage deeper exploration.</li>

<li>Quotes and inspiration from influential people who have shaped fields I admire.</li></ul>

<p>As this encyclopedia grows, my goal is to make learning fun, accessible, and rewarding—not just for myself but for everyone who visits. Whether you want to discover something new, revisit a favorite topic, or see what I’ve been working on lately, I hope you enjoy browsing My Wikipidea.</h4>
